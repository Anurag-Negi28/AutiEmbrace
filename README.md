### About the Project
AutiEmbrace is a comprehensive web application designed to serve as a holistic platform catering to the diverse needs of autistic children. Our mission is to create a nurturing and inclusive digital space where children on the autism spectrum can learn, play, relax, and connect with peers in a supportive environment. We understand that every child is different, with their own strengths, obstacles, and passions. That's why AutiEmbrace is flexible and can be tailored to each user's preferences and requirements. Whether it's through educational materials suited to their learning preferences, fun games that match their interests, or a supportive community where they feel appreciated and heard, AutiEmbrace aims to offer a platform that respects and encourages the unique qualities of every child on the autism spectrum.

**Learn** <br>
The "Learn" section of AutiEmbrace is dedicated to empowering autistic children with valuable knowledge and skills. Here, users can explore various topics such as self-confidence, personal development, and more through interactive and engaging content.

**Play** <br>
In the "Play" section, users can immerse themselves in a collection of games carefully curated to promote entertainment and cognitive development. These games are designed with the unique needs and preferences of autistic children in mind, offering a fun and stimulating experience.

**Connect** <br>
At AutiEmbrace, we understand the importance of community and social interaction for children on the autism spectrum. Through our "Connect" feature, users can join our loving and inclusive Discord community, where they can engage with like-minded individuals, share experiences, and form meaningful connections in a safe and supportive space.

**Relax** <br>
AutiEmbrace recognizes the significance of relaxation and sensory stimulation for autistic children. Our "Relax" section offers sensory rooms equipped with visual and ambient elements designed to create a calming and soothing environment where users can unwind, de-stress, and chill at their own pace.
